# Little Man Computer (LMC) Scripts

## Description

Welcome to the Little Man Computer (LMC) Scripts repository! This collection houses various scripts written for the Little Man Computer, a simulator designed by Peter Higginson.

LMC is an educational tool that emulates a simplified computer architecture, making it an excellent platform for learning and practicing assembly language programming. The scripts in this repository cover a range of concepts, from basic arithmetic operations to more complex algorithms.

### How to Run

1. Visit the [LMC simulator](https://peterhigginson.co.uk/lmc/).
2. Copy and paste the LMC assembly code from the `Script` directory into the simulator.
3. Execute the code to observe its behavior.

Feel free to explore, modify, and learn from these scripts. Enjoy.

## Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)
